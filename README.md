Coursework: Early Screening Machine Learning Models for Lung Cancer Detection

This project aims to develop machine learning models to assist doctors in early screening for lung cancer. Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death, and early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. The models analyze risk factors such as smoking, genetic mutations, second-hand smoke, and exposure to substances like asbestos or radon. By enhancing recommendations for further scans, this tool supports better diagnostic decisions and ultimately improves patient care.
